### Notes

* Time zone is off when purchasing. This is probably due to the server being in a different time zone than the client.
* Searching highlights are buggy.

### Reminders

* Don't completely wipe database or else some test cases will fail.
* Cloning:
  * Copy dependencies.
  * Change absolute path in `Database.cpp`.
* Hosting:
    * Write down pm2 IDs.
    * Use environment variables for ports and server url.
